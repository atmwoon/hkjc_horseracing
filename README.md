# Predicting Horse Racing Results
### Andrew Woon
August 2020


This repository contains my final Business Analytics (BA) report submission for my completed Business Analytics master's program at Imperial College Business School, London. 

The report titled "Predicting Horse Racing Results" aimed to identify winning horses at the Hong Kong Jockey Club (HKJC) horse racing events using machine learning on publicly available historic datasets. 

The full report is available through the following `onedrive` link: https://1drv.ms/b/s!Av8dtuCK1Jh5lUzl2FaAukhs5rBu?e=AiibcF

The coding/analysis is split across three sequential Jupyter Notebooks in this repository, which should be viewed in the following order through the `nbviewer` links provided:
